# NYC Fire Station Spatial-Temporal Analysis - CSE6242 Project

**Team:** Team 139
**Members:** Tyler, Vinuka, Harshitha, Rishi, Madeleine, Kevin

## Project Overview

This project analyzed NYC fire incidents using spatio-temporal data. Key objectives included predicting fire incident probability using wavelet features and optimizing potential new fire station locations using KDE and Genetic Algorithms. This repository contains the analysis code, notebooks, and an interactive Streamlit application to display results.

Application built with [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io)

## Live Application Demo

The interactive dashboard is deployed on Render:

**➡️ [https://fire-station-spatial-temporal-analysis.onrender.com](https://fire-station-spatial-temporal-analysis.onrender.com)**

### Important Info [DO NOT SKIP THIS SECTION]

*Note: The free tier [Render](https://render.com) (AWS/GCP/Azure alternative) instance may take ~30-60 seconds to wake up if inactive. This ensures that we do not get charged, without having to set AWS Cloudwatch Alarms or a similar option on GCP/Azure.*

#### **If you simply want to use the deployed app, there is no need to continue below here, the rest is for local setup.**

## Running Locally

Follow these steps precisely to run the Streamlit application on your local machine.

**1. Prerequisites:**
   * Python 3.11 (Ensure it's in your system's PATH)
   * Pipenv (`pip install pipenv`)

**2. Setup Project:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/tyler-netek/fire-station-spatial-temporal-analysis-project.git](https://github.com/tyler-netek/fire-station-spatial-temporal-analysis-project.git)
   cd fire-station-spatial-temporal-analysis-project
   pipenv shell
   pipenv install
   ```

**3. Offline Analysis Steps (Required for Full App Functionality):**
   The Streamlit app displays results generated by the following scripts/notebooks. Run these **before** launching the app locally. Execute commands from the project root directory within the virtual environment (`pipenv shell`).
   * **Activate Environment:** `pipenv shell`
   * **Generate GA Results:**
      * Run: `python Optimization/Genetic_algo_final.py`
      * *Ensure this script is modified to save its output DataFrame to:* `Optimization/Data/optimal_ga_locations.csv` (This might potentially already exist, but putting here in case it doesn't.)
   * **Generate KDE/K-Medoids Results:**
      * Run the `Optimization/KDE+ New Fire Station Locations(K Medoids).ipynb` notebook (e.g., using `jupyter lab`).
      * *Verify paths inside the notebook. Ensure it reads required inputs (like PLUTO) and saves its outputs:* `Optimization/Data/Potential_location.csv` and `Optimization/Data/kde_by_zipcode.csv`. (Might already exist, please check.)
   * **Generate Prediction Output File:**
      * Run the `Prediction/Predict Fire Incidents.ipynb` notebook.
      * *Ensure it saves its output to:* `Prediction/Data/fire_incident_prediction_output.csv`.
   * **Generate Merged DNN Features File:**
      * Run the `Prediction/fire_incident_prediction_model_development.ipynb` notebook (at least partially).
      * *Ensure it saves the merged 'df' DataFrame to:* `Prediction/Data/merged_dnn_input_features.csv`.
   * **Exit Environment:** `exit`

**4. Run the Streamlit App:**
   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   * Access the application in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
